Pyramus is an institute type independent school administration system, which is based on the ideology of project management. Project tasks (modules, courses) are scheduled in accordance to resources (teachers, rooms, equipment) after which the data is turned into costs and incomes. This enables synchronized course and financial planning as well as automatic project tracking and reporting. In addition to planning, the software produces simultaneously reports of financial and pedagogical data (e.g. credits) from the course and project level up to the school level.
